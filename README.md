## BeagleV Starlight beta prototype
[BeagleV Starlight](https://beagleboard.org/beaglev) is a Linux-capable RISC-V 64-bit dev board.

A [beta prototype version](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/BeagleV-Getting-Started/#faq) has been sent to a limited number of upstream developers for software enablement.  This beta prototype uses the StarFive JH7100 SoC.  **The hardware design is not final and modifications are expected.**

Please [join our public BeagleV forum](https://forum.beagleboard.org/c/beaglev/15) for updates on the official product launch of the BeagleV Starlight with distributors.

### Guidance on naming conventions
* Spelling should be BeagleV not Beagle-V
  * BeagleV is BeagleBoard.org Foundation's name for RISC-V boards
* The board name is [BeagleV Starlight](https://github.com/beagleboard/beaglev-starlight) for this board.
  * The board that limited number of developers have thus far received is beta version of the BeagleV Starlight
  * [This FAQ](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/BeagleV-Getting-Started/#faq) describes difference between beta and production.
* Board vendor is BeagleBoard.org Foundation
  * BeagleV Starlight is manufactured by Seeed Studio for BeagleBoard.org Foundation
  * Refer to`"^beagle,.*"` in [vendor-prefixes.yaml](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/)
* StarFive SoC: VIC renamed to JH
  * The beta BeagleV Starlight board has StarFive JH7100 SoC
  * StarFive had referred it internally as VIC7100 but the public name is JH7100
  * StarFive has renamed datasheet to [JH7100](https://github.com/starfive-tech/beaglev_doc/blob/main/JH7100%20Data%20Sheet%20V01.01.04-EN%20(4-21-2021).pdf)
  * There are still many references to VIC and VIC7100 instead of JH7100 which will be cleaned up
* StarFive JH7100 versus JH7110
  * The beta BeagleV Starlight board has the StarFive JH7100
  * StarFive JH7110 is mass production chip which will be used in future BeagleV Starlight boards
    * JH7110 upgrade from 2x to 4x U74 cores and adds PCIe and GPU
  * Recommendation is to use `beagle,beaglev-starlight-jh7100` and `beagle,beaglev-starlight-jh7110` to differientate between the board versions
* SiFive cores in the StarFive SoC:
  * StarFive JH7100 SoC has 2x SiFive U74-MC
  * StarFive JH7110 SoC will have 4x SiFive U74-MC
